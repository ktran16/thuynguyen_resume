## SUMMARY

I have a strong track record of building businesses and marketplace teams. My experience has been in hyper-growth industries being transformed through the internet and technology and relying on data-driven operations, fast-paced scaling, offline-online growth, optimized pricing, and a lot of hustle to drive growth and long-term sustainability.

My background in marketplace, strategy, operations, digital marketing and business development enables me to be comfortable with numbers and data-ops and at the same time, I am able to zoom in and zoom out quickly to make better decisions for the business. My expertise is in Business Strategy, Marketplace Balance, Data Operations, Product-led Growth, Spending optimization, and Pricing Strategy.
